  <h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h2>

  <p>Accessibility on the web is an important next step towards a more considerate and efficient future. The primary focus is to ensure that disabled and/or elderly people are able to access the same information as an abled user. In doing so, there are often greater benefits that extend beyond the particular demographic that an accessibility function was intended for.</p><p>It's extremely important to ensure that the greatest number of users are able to comfortably use a website to its full functionality. Systems in place that bar or impede certain demographics are a hinderance that is easy to overlook if the people putting these systems in place fail to be properly considerate. When technology is created for a specific demographic, it often excludes those it was not intended for (intentionally or not).</p>
