      <h2>Thoughts on Accessibility</h2>

      <p>Accessibility on the web is an important next step towards a more considerate and efficient future. The primary focus is to ensure that disabled and/or elderly people are able to access the same information as an abled user. In doing so, there are often greater benefits that extend beyond the particular demographic that an accessibility function was intended for.</p><p>It's extremely important to ensure that the greatest number of users are able to comfortably use a website to its full functionality. Systems in place that bar or impede certain demographics are a hinderance that is easy to overlook if the people putting these systems in place fail to be properly considerate. When technology is created for a specific demographic, it often excludes those it was not intended for (intentionally or not).</p>

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a concept similar to graceful degredation - both are concerned with how a site functions on a variety of devices, especially as technology progresses. The key difference is in the way that the two concepts approach the question.</p><p>Graceful degredation tackles the problem from the top by starting with the most optimal browsing experience (a good desktop or laptop with a modern browser) and builds for that. Testing on older browsers and devices is a secondary consideration, ensuring only minimum functionality. Progressive enhancement starts from the bottom and works up - it is content-focused, prioritizing making as much accessible to as many devices as possible by building additional functionality instead of designing the "best" site and then working backwards.</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement">This article</a> helps to lay out the differences between the two concepts in more plain language, comparing them directly.</p>

      <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <p>This has been an incredibly interesting and engaging project to work on. It was a challenge of both design and technical skill.</p>

      <p>The feedback I received was largely positive, with two main points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Line spacing felt too narrow with the chosen font.</li>
        <li>The header took up too much space on the screen, making it difficult to be sure that the page had changed at first.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Both of these were relatively easy fixes - I decided to keep the larger header on the index page because I liked how it looked, but I reduced the size on the rest of the pages to make the actual content more of a focus.</p>

      <p>Additionally, I made the following major change as well:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Made sure the entire site functions with a narrowed window, including dynamically changing the layout on each page to ensure full readability.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>It took me a good amount of time to decide how I wanted the site's overall layout to look. On the one hand, I should have taken more time to decide ahead of time what I wanted it to look like and create mockups of potential layouts. On the other, I feel like going through the process of creating and then editing my own work has been extremely valuable. It's amazing how much you can forget about what you were doing if you walk away from it for three days.</p>
      
      <p>If I had more time on this project or if I were to do it again, I would definitely put more effort into the names of the classes and IDs of each element I was working on. I made the names of many elements too similar, and it confused me a few times. I'd prefer to type out longer names that are more precise than try to figure out the differenc between block-content and content-block. I would also try to simplify some of my design elements, making more use of outlines to separate content rather than putting everything in their own divs. It may not end up quite as nice, though, so I'll have to experiment with that on my own.</p>

      <p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I may return after writing this to make minor changes (including some javascript, I'd like to see if I can figure out how to make the header background change like a slideshow), and if so I'll update the major changes section above.</p>
